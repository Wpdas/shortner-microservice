      readme: "# API Project: URL Shortener Microservice for freeCodeCamp\n\n\n### User Stories\n\n1. I can POST a URL to `[project_url]/api/shorturl/new` and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response. Example : `{\"original_url\":\"www.google.com\",\"short_url\":1}`\n2. If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http(s)://www.example.com(/more/routes)` format, the JSON response will contain an error like `{\"error\":\"invalid URL\"}`. *HINT*: to be sure that the submitted url points to a valid site you can use the function `dns.lookup(host, cb)` from the `dns` core module.\n3. When I visit the shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.\n\n\n#### Creation Example:\n\nPOST [project_url]/api/shorturl/new - body (urlencoded) :  url=https://www.google.com\n\n#### Usage:\n\n[this_project_url]/api/shorturl/3\n\n#### Will redirect to:\n\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/"
